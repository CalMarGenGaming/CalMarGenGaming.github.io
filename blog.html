                          Hi friends!  My name’s Rachel Hunt, and I’m a former CMGG Board Member. I graduated from Cal Spring ’23, but still love playing League with all the CMGG homies. In college, I explored careers in publishing, research, and the gaming industry. Now, I work as a Paralegal for the DOJ Antitrust Division. My supervisor saw CMGG on my resume and assigned me to our tech cases. My free time is spent playing LoL and VAL, drawing (learned the hard way thru CMGG’s Game Jam that digital drawing is NOT the same), gyming, traveling, and cuddling with my quarantine cat Sibyl. Always happy to connect with y’all!

                        <b>Bio: </b>
                          Hellaurrr! I'm Hannah Lee, a super senior (4 and 1/2 years *whips) at Cal! I'm studying political economy and minoring in public policy. 
                          While my career interests lean more towards the public sector and legislation, I love to play games in my personal time! I play League (ironically and badly), 
                          Honkai Star Rail, and The Sims 4! Growing up, I gravitated towards story-rich games like Persona, The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, (anything Telltale honestly), 
                          Harvest Moon (on Nintendo), and Tomb Raider (2013). I love getting attached to 2D characters and witnessing their growth and suffering :) 
                          If you've ever played any of these games, I'd love to talk and trash about them! The first and only game jam I've ever participated in was CMGG's 2022 Game Jam! 
                          I helped create a visual novel, which is about Cubbie, our mascot, who goes on a journey to recover their iconic headphones and console as well as to discover who 
                          they really are and where they belong. I created some of the art assets and wrote the storyline and dialogue for the visual novel. It was an amazing experience 
                          working with other passionate gamers and creators! I joined CMGG as a sophomore and the last 3 years with this club have been a wonderful experience. While I started out 
                          more as a discord lurker, I've participated in more in-person and discord events. In doing so, I've met many who share similar interests and identities, which has made gaming 
                          not only more fun but also social for me! Currently, I am in the mentorship program and while I have no plans to join the gaming industry, I have received incredibly insightful 
                          advice that is applicable to my own life and reassuring stories I can relate to in regards to my professional career. From the annual Halloween LANs at the esports center to 
                          the numerous coffee chats with industry professionals to the cute weekly discord events, I have created everlasting memories and so I have nothing but gratitude and pride for CMGG.

                        ello!! It's Tori and I've been in the CMGG discord since 2020! My two proudest achievements have been graduating with
                        honors in Berkeley and getting experience in the field of education! It's been rewarding seeing the kids I instruct
                        mature and improve in their reading. It's having me consider applying for a masters in education :) perhaps at Cal
                        again. In my free time, I like to watch anime and draw! For video games, I like to play Genshin, Pokemon, and life
                        simulator games like Sims and Animal Crossing. I also enjoy watching twitch streamers play horror and story based games!
                        My major was in History, so I also like to read about topics like LGBT US history, and women's history. If you have any
                        recommendations on games or readings I can check out, I'm up for it!

                        been involved in CMGG, BL, and GDD since freshman year, and would be delighted to answer any questions anyone has about
                        these clubs! I'm also ridiculously familiar with logistics relating to making and hosting a decal, so if anyone's
                        interested in that lmk 👀 I used to want to be an illustrator or concept artist, but nowadays I'm exploring 3D game art
                        fields and seeing what I like there. When I have the time to though, I still make stickers and emotes for fun. In terms
                        of games I play, the biggest one is definitely League of Legends (go Nami!), followed by Punishing: Gray Raven, and
                        whatever MMORPG currently has my attention (GW2). I'm always happy to chat or make new friends, so feel free to ping or

                        playing a lot of rhythm/arcade games like Project Sekai, Project Diva, and DDR. So the cool project I wanted to share
                        with everyone is a game that I worked on!
                        
                        [ME][TA]L is a short, metal-themed rhythm game that I worked on last semester with a group of friends in the GDD Decal.
                        I had a lot of fun making it, and I learned a bunch of things about the Unity Game Engine that I didn't know before.

                        Hi, I'm Sara! I'm a 4th year philosophy student and this is my second year being apart of CMGG 💗💗 If you've seen
                        me around, you probably know that I love expressing myself with fun, bright colors and accessories! The first game I
                        really got into (besides minecraft) was overwatch back in early 2017, and you can still find me playing it nearly every
                        day. I'm a support/tank player so if you ever want to queue together let me know :3 I also really enjoy genshin impact,
                        tetris, and a lot of other indie games with pretty art and music 🪷🌟 Besides gaming, I really love music - both
                        listening and playing piano/guitar, arts and crafts, and learning about topics in applied ethics. You can find me on the
                        CMGG discord server a lot (orchin#1863) so please say hi if you wanna talk or are interested in any of these topics too!
                        :D 💫🌸🦦

                        Hello!!! I'm Annika Liu, a freshman studying CS and Media Studies and also an intended game designer! I'm a big fan
                        for Blizzard games and my favorites are Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm, and World of Warcraft. In my free time I also do
                        digital art and watch anime. The most recent anime I watched is Neon Genesis Evangelion. I loved the story plot and
                        character designs. My battle.net id is k1ss#11639. If you ever wanna play Blizzard games or any other games, message me
                        and I'm happy to try almost any games:D

                        Hi y'all! I'm a Marketing Writer at Riot Games, but before that I was a CMGG Board member for 3 years +
                        graduated
                        from Cal as part of the class of 2021. CMGG was definitely the most important part of my college experience
                        and I'm glad
                        to still be involved as a mentor! I work on all kinds of projects at Riot, mostly on Wild Rift and League of
                        Legends PC.
                        My favorite thing I've worked on lately that's out in the world is the Nilah Champion Spotlight, which you
                        can watch
                        here:

                    <p class="post_text">
                        I love to play ranked League of Legends and recently I've been super into Fortnite. I'm also finishing up
                        Kirby and the
                        Forgotten Land on my Switch. Outside of games, I love to take film photos, thrift clothing, and I've started
                        learning
                        how to draw digitally. I also like making all my friends watch the Bachelor with me.

                        with pretty art heh- 😸. I'm still working on improving and uploading more but you can find some of my art on my
