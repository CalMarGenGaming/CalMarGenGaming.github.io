        <div class="container" style="width: 80%" style="text-align: center">
            <h1>Do I need to pay anything to be a member or participate in CWG events? </h1>
            <p>Membership is free to all Cal students. Our events do not require you to pay anything; access to the Cal Esports Community center is free as a part of our events. Groups of CWG members may have social events where they eat dinner together; we would not pay for those expenses, but these events are not mandatory and we have other events </p>
            <h1>Do I need to own a certain type of gaming device or certain games to participate in your events? </h1>
            <p>Members may bring consoles like Nintendo Switches to events to share but that is by no means required. For events at the Cal Esports Community Center, there are a variety of games already installed on the PCs and CWG members do not need to pay to use the computers. 
                <br>Our online events require internet access and we do not provide copies of paid games for you to play on personal devices. We try to hold a variety of events that include playing free games together, and if you don’t own a certain game you’re more than welcome to still join and watch! 
                </p>
            <h1>What are the requirements for me to be a member? </h1>
            <p>You must be a student at UC Berkeley. Other than that, we welcome gamers of all skill levels and gaming interests who support our mission. However, we have members of our Discord server who are from other colleges or are not current students; these exceptions are determined on a case by case basis. <br>There isn’t any minimum number of events you’re required to attend for membership; feel free to join whenever you feel like! </p>
            <h1>I want to be a part of CWG but it’s the middle of the semester. Is it too late to get involved?</h1>
            <p>No, feel free to join us anytime! However, signups for our one on one mentorship program and board applications typically occur at the beginning of the academic year (August/September). </p>
            <h1>I’m interested in joining club leadership (board). How can I do that? </h1>
            <p>We typically recruit new board members at the beginning of each academic year (August/September). Board applications will be shared on our social media. </p>
            <h1>What kinds of games do you play together?</h1>
            <p>The current most popular games among our members are League of Legends and Overwatch, but our members play a huge variety of games; we’re sure you’ll find someone here with some common interests. </p>
            <h1>How do you foster a “supportive and safe” online community? </h1>
            <p>Our Discord server has a strict verification system and we personally verify each and every person that wants access to our server</p>
            <h1>Do I need to be a “woman” to join? </h1>
            <p>Cal Women in Gaming is focused on the empowerment of gender minorities but supports empowerment on all levels. We ask that all members support this mission in good faith.</p>
